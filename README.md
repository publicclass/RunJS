# RunJS

A simple lightweight library to run the appropriate scripts depending on a pathname or selector.


## Background

We, at [Public Class](http://publicclass.se), try to organize our client side javascript in jQuery plugins as much as possible, but even the nicely encapsulated jQuery plugins need to be initialized somewhere, usually in a "document ready"-method.

And we felt a need to organize our initializeres depending on which page we're at to avoid our "document ready"-method to look like this:

    $(function(){
      if( $(".drag-drop").length ){
        // jQuery UI sorting 
        $(".drag-drop").sortable({
          // plenty of configuration
        })
        // (and somewhere else we'll need to re-init this to update the sortable when the lists have changed etc...)
      }
      
      
      if( $(".overlay").length ){
        // Implement some kind of js overlay
        $(".overlay").modal("some-overlay.html")
        $(".overlay a.close").click(function(){
          $.modal("close")
        })
      }
      
      if( $("#special-form").length ){
        // Custom Validations
        // AJAX submissions
        // etc...
      }
      
      // And so on usually ending up in an uncomfortable list of ifs and initializers...
      
    })


## Solution

A little method which "runs" depending on either the current page (yay, organize by different pages/paths in the same script!) or by CSS selector (similar to above, but if-less).


## Usage

    // Run when pathname ends with /slideshow
    // the splatted part (the '*all'-part) is passed on
    // as an argument along with the complete url
    $.run("/*all/slideshow",function(all,url){
      $(".slideshow").load(all)
    })
    
    // Run when a selector is matched on the page
    $.run(".pagination",function(){
      // `this` will be the same as if it was called through $(".pagination")
    })
    
    // Basically the same as $(), but here for completeness
    $.run(function(){
      
    })

    // Also add them all at once by passing an object
    $.run({
      // Run these when the url ends with /slideshow
      "/*all/slideshow": function(all,url){},
      
      // Run this on url '/press'
      "/press": function(url){},
      
      // Run this if '.pagination' selector is found
      ".pagination": function(){}
    })


## Features

* Run scripts based on a pathname or a css selector

* The _pathname_ should be parsed from either (in this order)
  
  1. a hashbang (i.e. a window.location.hash starting with #!)
  2. address bar (i.e. the window.location.pathname)

* Run the script again (in case anything has updated)

        window.addEventListener("hashchange",function(){
          // Run all (currently matching) routes again
          $.run()
          
          // Run only a particular one
          $.run("/*all/slideshow")
        })

## History

### 0.3.0

* [Fixed] `$.run.again()` didn't really work as it used a non-referenced variable. Now it has a test to make sure.
* [Added] Now we have a simple build tool in the [Makefile](./Makefile).
* [Added] Refactored into using Route instances. This should make it faster in modern javascript engines. And much more readable.

### 0.2.1

* [Added] `$.run.again()` which should be called anytime a selector has to be run again.
* [Fixed] If two selector-routes matched an element only the first would be used. Now they're selector specific and shouldn't conflict.


### 0.2.0

* [Added] Applies a "run"-attribute to the element so it won't be rerun unless told to (by removing that attribute).


### 0.1.1

* [Added] The catch-all style:

        $.run(function(){
          // I'll be called every time!
        })


### 0.1.0

* Initial version.


## TODO

By the big `1.0` we should also have a few extra features like:

* Adapters for hashchange and push/pop-State that runs, ehm, `$.run()` whenever it has changed
* Work just as well without jQuery (i.e. be framework agnostic) and only support selectors if a selector engine is available (like Sizzle or document.querySelectorAll)
* Allow loading of external scripts depending on route (if Modernizr is available) before the callback is called (i.e. it'll be the 'complete'-callback instead)
* Maybe be able to name the routes so it'll be more convenient to rerun a particular route
* Maybe return the matched wildcards in the route of a pathname in a params-hash instead


## Testing

Open up [test-run.html](./test/test-run.html) in a browser, click around and see that no exceptions are thrown (probably found in the console).

For the [History.js](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/) tests it needs to be run from a web server to be able to rewrite those urls with `History.pushState`.

## Building

To build you need to install [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) which is used for minification. It's simply done using npm: `npm i uglify-js -g`.

Then all you need is to run:

```
> make
```

and optionally add a version

```
> make VERSION=0.4.0-bob
```
